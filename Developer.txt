C# Developer- Home Task
Scenario:
You’ve been hired to build the backend logic for a smart parking system. The system manages multiple parking lots, each with a set of parking spots. Users can park and unpark their vehicles, and the system should track spot availability and calculate parking fees.

Your Tasks
1. Design the Core Classes
Create the following classes with appropriate properties and methods:
* ParkingLot
o Has a name, hourly rate, and a fixed number of parking spots.
o Manages available and occupied spots.
* ParkingSpot
o Has a unique ID.
o Can hold one vehicle at a time.
o Tracks whether it’s occupied.
* Vehicle
o Has a license plate (string).
o Has a type (e.g., car, motorcycle).
* ParkingSession
o Tracks when a vehicle enters and exits a parking spot.
o Calculates the total parking time and fee.

2. Implement the Following Logic
* When a vehicle enters a parking lot:
o Assign it to an available spot.
o Start a parking session.
* When a vehicle leaves:
o End the parking session.
o Calculate the parking fee based on the time spent and the parking lot’s hourly rate.

3. Constraints
Make sure your implementation follows these rules:
* A parking spot can hold only one vehicle at a time.
* Each vehicle has: 
o A license plate (string)
o A type (e.g., car, motorcycle)
* Each parking lot has a fixed number of spots.
* Different parking lots may have different hourly rates.


4. Please answer the following questions:
1. What is the difference between class and struct in C#?
2. What is a try-catch-finally block, and when should you use it?
3. What is the difference between Select, Where, FirstOrDefault, and Any?
4. Explain the four principles of Object Oriented Programming: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism.
